# FPTree

An implementation of the [FP tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning#FP-growth_algorithm) growth algorithm used in association rule mining. Developed in partial fulfilment for the Data Mining Course offered at my University.

Data set used: [pima-indians-diabetes](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pima+indians+diabetes).

Pre-processed the data set for associative rule mining, [pre-processed dataset](./pima-indians-diabetes.data), then applied the FP tree growth algorithm to form rules.

Please refer to [documention.pdf](./documentation.pdf) file for details on how to run the code.
